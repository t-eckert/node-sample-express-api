# Node Sample Express API

This is a node application that runs a web server using Express to greet the user.

This example is used as demonstration for the blog post "[]()".

## Quickstart

> Requires NPM and Node

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Start the server

```bash
node index.js
```

In a web browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`. The text "Hello world." should load. Pass a "name" parameter on the URL. For example, `localhost:3000?name=Thomas`. The text "Hello Thomas." should load.
